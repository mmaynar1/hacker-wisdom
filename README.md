# hacker-wisdom

The source code for https://www.askhnwisdom.com/

A web application built with Java, Apache Maven, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and the Hacker News API to display links submitted in the "Ask HN" comments.

I visit [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) fairly regularly, and one section I particularly enjoy is called "[Ask HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/ask)". In this section of the website, people ask for advice on all sorts of topics. There are usually interesting pieces of advice and conversations that follow in the comments.

I often find myself reading through these comment sections and saving off interesting links that commenters provide in their answers. There is a lot of collective widsom and experience to be found there. I felt like it would fit the spirit of Hacker News to automate that process.
