            Some of the most valuable information on Hacker News can be found in the comment section. I often find myself
            reading through interesting responses to interesting <a th:href="@{https://news.ycombinator.com/ask}">"Ask HN" questions</a> and saving off linked content for reading
            in the future.

        <p>It seemed in the spirit of Hacker News to automate part of this process and make it into a little web
            application.
